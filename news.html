                The petitioner, one Nagalaxmi Laxmi Narayan, has raised grievance with the 2024 'Handling End of Life Vehicles in Public Places of Delhi' guidelines that mandatorily require the scrapping of diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years irrespective of their roadworthiness.
                
                "The retrospective application of the guidelines to vehicles is arbitrary, violates the Applicantâ€™s legitimate expectation, and deprives the Applicant of their right to property under Article 300A of the Constitution," it has been contended.
                
                The plea, as is the norm in environmental cases before the apex court, has been filed as an impleadment application in the already pending MC Mehta matter.</div>

            <div class="accordion-body">Bengal Doctors End Cease-Work, To Resume Essential Services From Saturday</strong> The junior doctors of Bengal called off their massive 40-day protest over the rape-murder of a colleague at a Kolkata hospital and said they will join work on Saturday. But there was a caveat - they said they will not join OPD services or attend elected operations. These would be resumed once they are assured of the state government's commitment to the safety issue, they said.
                The announcement came after the state had accepted most of their demands -- and amid massive floods in south Bengal where health services have become a priority.

                Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have been on a tour of the flood-hit areas since yesterday. It was the Chief Secretary who attended the last meeting with the doctors on Wednesday and accepted their demands and suggestions regarding security. </div>
